This is a beginner's guide to learning Git and Github from scratch.

### Setting Up Git

To get started with Git, you need to install it on your system. You can download the latest version of Git from the official website.

### Basic Git Commands
---------------------

Here are some basic Git commands to get you started:

* `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
* `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory.
* `git commit -m "message"`: Commits changes with a meaningful message.
* `git log`: Displays a log of all commits made.

### Working with Github

Github is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration. Here's how you can work with Github:

* Create a new repository on Github.
* Clone the repository to your local system using `git clone`.
* Make changes to your code and commit them using `git commit`.
* Push your changes to Github using `git push`.
